# Ralph's Website
Welcome to the official website of my late dog, Ralph. He passed away at the age of four in Novemeber 2022 due to unknown sickness. This is a webpage that I created for him, as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) curriculum. Note that most buttons and links do not work, except for the "Donate" link.
